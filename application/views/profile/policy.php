                     <h4>Talkmos Cookie Policy</h4> 
                     <p>This Cookie Policy ("Cookie Policy") is a part of and incorporated within and is to be read along with the Terms of Use ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. The capitalized terms used in this Cookie Policy, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Terms.</p>
                     
                     <h3>What are cookies, pixels, and local storage?#</h3>
                     <p>Cookies are small files that the websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, we use cookies to discover how people are using our Platform and to make them work better.
</p>


<p>A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many other websites do, we use pixels to learn whether youâ€™ve interacted with certain web or email content. This helps us measure and improve our Platform and personalize your experience on our Platform.</p>

<p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with our Platform.
</p>
<h3>Why do we use these technologies?#</h3>
<p>We may use these technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience and help protect us and our users. We may use these to provide you with services on our Platform, that are easier and faster to use, and enable you to easily navigate our Platform and use its features. We may use these to retain authentication information in order to provide certain services to you, to retain your language preference and to provide mapping and location-based services which require your location. We may use these technologies to store information about how you use our Platform, for instance, what pages you visit most often, and if visiting some pages gives you error messages. We may use these technologies to collect information on the total number of visitors to our Platform on an ongoing basis. We may, along with our advertising partners, use these technologies to deliver, understand and improve advertisements that you see.
</p>
<p>We cannot identify you personally from the information these cookies collect. Only for functionality purposes, personally identifiable information that you disclose like your username and profile picture may be collected. We ensure complete transparency with you about what information is collected, how it is going to be used and with whom it is shared.</p>

<h3>What types of cookies do we use?#</h3>
<p>Two types of cookies may be used on our Platform- "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave our Platform. A persistent cookie remains on your device for much longer or until you manually delete it (how long the cookie remains on your device will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific cookie and your app settings).</p>


<p>Some of the pages you visit may also collect information using pixel tags (also called clear gifs) that may be shared with third parties which directly support our promotional activities and Platform development. For example, usage information about visitors of our Platform may be shared with our third party advertising agency to better target internet banner advertisements on Platform. The information is not, however, personally identifiable, although it could be linked to your personal information.
</p>

<h3>Where are these technologies used?#</h3>

<p>	We use these technologies on our own Platform and on other websites that may have integrated our services. This includes our advertising and platform partners. Third parties may also use these technologies, for example, when you interact with their content from within Platform, like when you click a link or stream media on our Platform from a third-party service, and to help with the delivery of advertisements that may be shown on and off of our Platform.
</p>


<h3>Do we use Third Party Cookies?#</h3>
<p>We use a number of suppliers that may also set cookies on your device on our behalf when you visit our Platform, to allow such third parties to deliver the services that they are providing.</p>

<p>When you visit our Platform, you may receive cookies from third party websites or domains. We endeavor to identify these cookies before they are used so that you can decide whether or not you wish to accept them. More information about these cookies may be available on the relevant third party's website.</p>

<h3>How can I control Cookies?#</h3>

<p>Most internet browsers are initially set up to automatically accept cookies. You can change the settings to block cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device. There are a number of ways to manage cookies. Please refer to our Platform instructions or help screen to learn more about how to adjust or modify your app settings.</p>

<p>If you disable the cookies that we use, this may impact your experience while on the Platform, for example you may not be able to visit certain areas of our Platform or you may not receive personalized information when you visit our Platform.</p>

<p>If you use different devices to view and access the Platform (e.g. your computer, smartphone, tablet etc.) you will need to ensure that each browser on each device is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Cookie Policy#</h3>
<p>We will occasionally update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes on our Platform and services. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, or share information held in cookies, we will post these changes to this Cookie Policy and revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of the Cookie Policy.</p>

<h3>Cookies that have been set in the past#</h3>
<p>If you have disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies prior to your disabled preference being set. However, we will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.</p>
<h3>Contact us#</h3>
